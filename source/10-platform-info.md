title: 10. PlatformInfo
description: PlatformInfo（待整理）
type: docs
---

Platform information is comprised of several identification fields
generated or filled manually to be compatible with macOS services. The
base part of the configuration may be obtained from
[\texttt{MacInfoPkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/MacInfoPkg)}
package, which itself generates a set of interfaces based on a database
in [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) format. These fields
are written to three select destinations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
 -   [SMBIOS](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios)
 -   \href{https://github.com/acidanthera/EfiPkg/blob/master/Include/Protocol/DataHub.h}{Data
  Hub}
 -   NVRAM
\end{itemize}

Most of the fields specify the overrides in SMBIOS, and their field
names conform to EDK2
[SmBios.h](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/UDK2018/MdePkg/Include/IndustryStandard/SmBios.h)
header file. However, several important fields reside in Data Hub and
NVRAM. Some of the values can be found in more than one field and/or
destination, so there are two ways to control their update process:
manual, where one specifies all the values (the default), and semi-automatic,
where (\texttt{Automatic}) only select values are specified, and later used
for system configuration.

To inspect SMBIOS contents [dmidecode](http://www.nongnu.org/dmidecode) utility can
be used. Version with macOS specific enhancements can be downloaded from
[Acidanthera/dmidecode](https://github.com/acidanthera/dmidecode/releases).

\subsection{Properties}\label{platforminfoprops}

\begin{enumerate}
 -   \texttt{Automatic}\\
  \textbf{Type}: \texttt{plist\ boolean}\\
  \textbf{Failsafe}: \texttt{false}\\
  \textbf{Description}: Generate PlatformInfo based on \texttt{Generic}
  section instead of using values from \texttt{DataHub}, \texttt{NVRAM},
  and \texttt{SMBIOS} sections.

  Enabling this option is useful when \texttt{Generic} section is flexible
  enough. When enabled \texttt{SMBIOS}, \texttt{DataHub}, and
  \texttt{PlatformNVRAM} data is unused.
 -   \texttt{UpdateDataHub}\\
  \textbf{Type}: \texttt{plist\ boolean}\\
  \textbf{Failsafe}: \texttt{false}\\
  \textbf{Description}: Update Data Hub fields. These fields are read
  from \texttt{Generic} or \texttt{DataHub} sections depending on
  \texttt{Automatic} value.
 -   \texttt{UpdateNVRAM}\\
  \textbf{Type}: \texttt{plist\ boolean}\\
  \textbf{Failsafe}: \texttt{false}\\
  \textbf{Description}: Update NVRAM fields related to platform information.

  These fields are read from \texttt{Generic} or \texttt{PlatformNVRAM} sections
  depending on \texttt{Automatic} value. All the other fields are
  to be specified with \texttt{NVRAM} section.

  If \texttt{UpdateNVRAM} is set to \texttt{false} the aforementioned
  variables can be updated with \hyperref[nvram]{\texttt{NVRAM}}
  section. If \texttt{UpdateNVRAM} is set to \texttt{true} the behaviour is
  undefined when any of the fields are present in \texttt{NVRAM} section.
 -   \texttt{UpdateSMBIOS}\\
  \textbf{Type}: \texttt{plist\ boolean}\\
  \textbf{Failsafe}: \texttt{false}\\
  \textbf{Description}: Update SMBIOS fields. These fields are read from
  \texttt{Generic} or \texttt{SMBIOS} sections depending on
  \texttt{Automatic} value.
 -   \texttt{UpdateSMBIOSMode}\\
  \textbf{Type}: \texttt{plist\ string}\\
  \textbf{Failsafe}: \texttt{Create}\\
  \textbf{Description}: Update SMBIOS fields approach:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
   -     \texttt{TryOverwrite} --- \texttt{Overwrite} if new size is \textless{}= than
    the page-aligned original and there are no issues with legacy region
    unlock. \texttt{Create} otherwise. Has issues with some firmwares.
   -     \texttt{Create} --- Replace the tables with newly allocated
    EfiReservedMemoryType at AllocateMaxAddress without any fallbacks.
   -     \texttt{Overwrite} --- Overwrite existing gEfiSmbiosTableGuid and
    gEfiSmbiosTable3Guid data if it fits new size. Abort with
    unspecified state otherwise.
   -     \texttt{Custom} --- Write first SMBIOS table
    (\texttt{gEfiSmbiosTableGuid}) to \texttt{gOcCustomSmbiosTableGuid}
    to workaround firmwares overwriting SMBIOS contents at
    ExitBootServices. Otherwise equivalent to \texttt{Create}. Requires
    patching AppleSmbios.kext and AppleACPIPlatform.kext to read from
    another GUID: \texttt{"EB9D2D31"} - \texttt{"EB9D2D35"} (in ASCII),
    done automatically by \texttt{CustomSMBIOSGuid} quirk.
  \end{itemize}
 -   \texttt{Generic}\\
  \textbf{Type}: \texttt{plist\ dictonary}\\
  \textbf{Optional}: When \texttt{Automatic} is \texttt{false}\\
  \textbf{Description}: Update all fields. This section is read only
  when \texttt{Automatic} is active.
 -   \texttt{DataHub}\\
  \textbf{Type}: \texttt{plist\ dictonary}\\
  \textbf{Optional}: When \texttt{Automatic} is \texttt{true}\\
  \textbf{Description}: Update Data Hub fields. This section is read
  only when \texttt{Automatic} is not active.
 -   \texttt{PlatformNVRAM}\\
  \textbf{Type}: \texttt{plist\ dictonary}\\
  \textbf{Optional}: When \texttt{Automatic} is \texttt{true}\\
  \textbf{Description}: Update platform NVRAM fields. This section is
  read only when \texttt{Automatic} is not active.
 -   \texttt{SMBIOS}\\
  \textbf{Type}: \texttt{plist\ dictonary}\\
  \textbf{Optional}: When \texttt{Automatic} is \texttt{true}\\
  \textbf{Description}: Update SMBIOS fields. This section is read only
  when \texttt{Automatic} is not active.
